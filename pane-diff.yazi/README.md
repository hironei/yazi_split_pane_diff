# pane-diff.yazi

`pane-diff.yazi` compares the file under the cursor, or one explicitly selected file, from each of two panes shown by `terrakok/split-tabs.yazi`. It passes the files to the external Diff tool configured through Git.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Environment | Git Bash or WSL, with Yazi and Git running in the same environment |
| Yazi | 26.8.15 tested baseline; 26.5.6 selected-URL compatibility is retained |
| `ya` | The same version as Yazi, for installing `split-tabs.yazi` |
| `terrakok/split-tabs.yazi` | Required for the two-pane view |
| Git | The same environment's `PATH` contains `git`, with an external difftool configured |
| Lua | Not required at runtime; only needed for the repository's mock tests |

At minimum, verify that these commands succeed:

```bash
yazi --version
ya --version
git --version
git difftool --tool-help
```

The plugin is tested against the public APIs available in Yazi 26.8.15 and the current `split-tabs.yazi` implementation. The small selected-entry adapter also accepts the direct URL shape used by older Yazi versions. Yazi APIs may change; retest the plugin after upgrading.

## Installation

### 1. Install split-tabs.yazi

Install the pane provider with Yazi's package manager:

```bash
ya pkg add terrakok/split-tabs
```

### 2. Install pane-diff.yazi

Install the plugin from its repository subdirectory:

```bash
ya pkg add hironei/yazi_split_pane_diff:pane-diff
```

`ya pkg` downloads the repository and places the plugin in Yazi's plugin directory. It records the installation in `package.toml`. Update it with `ya pkg upgrade`, or remove it with:

```bash
ya pkg delete hironei/yazi_split_pane_diff:pane-diff
```

### 3. Verify the installation

For Windows Yazi used from Git Bash, verify `%AppData%/yazi/config/plugins/pane-diff.yazi/main.lua`. For Linux Yazi used from WSL, verify `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/yazi/plugins/pane-diff.yazi/main.lua`.

The same configuration directory's `package.toml` should contain `hironei/yazi_split_pane_diff:pane-diff`.

Restart Yazi after changing its configuration.

## Keymap

Add this to the `keymap.toml` used by your Yazi environment. For Git Bash, this is `%AppData%/yazi/config/keymap.toml` for Windows Yazi. For WSL, it is `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/yazi/keymap.toml`.

```toml
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on = [ "g", "d" ]
run = "plugin pane-diff"
desc = "Compare files in split panes"
```

If the `g` prefix conflicts with an existing mapping, choose another key, for example:

```toml
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on = "D"
run = "plugin pane-diff"
desc = "Compare files in split panes"
```

The same example is available in [`examples/keymap.toml`](../examples/keymap.toml).

## Basic operation

1. Enable `split-tabs.yazi` and show two panes.
2. Place the cursor on the file to compare in each pane.
3. Press `g`, then `d`.

The active pane's file is passed as the first argument to the Diff tool, and the other pane's file is passed as the second argument. Switching the active pane therefore reverses the argument order. Physical screen-left and screen-right ordering is not guaranteed.

## Target selection

Each pane uses this priority order:

1. If exactly one file is explicitly selected, use it.
2. If there is no explicit selection, use the file under the cursor.
3. Do not launch when two or more files are selected.
4. Do not launch when there is no item under the cursor.
5. Do not launch for directories, unresolved symbolic links, or non-regular files.

The plugin does not change the selection state, cursor position, or Yazi's current directory.

On Yazi 26.8.15, selected values are `File` entries and the plugin resolves each entry through its `.url`. Direct URL-shaped selected values from older versions remain supported.

## Git Difftool configuration

The plugin adds `--no-index` so that files outside a Git repository can also be compared. It starts the equivalent of:

```text
git difftool --no-index --no-prompt -- <active-file> <other-file>
```

For this `--no-index` invocation, exit code 1 can mean that the files differ. The plugin accepts exit codes 0 and 1 as expected results and reports other non-zero exit statuses as process failures. Launch and wait failures are always reported. The child status API cannot distinguish an external tool's independent use of code 1, so only code 1 is treated as the expected result for this fixed Git invocation.

For example, configure WinMerge as Git's difftool:

- Git Bash: configure a Windows WinMerge executable that Git Bash can start.
- WSL: configure a Linux Diff tool available inside WSL. To use a Windows executable, provide a command that WSL can invoke.

```bash
git config --global diff.tool winmerge
git config --global difftool.winmerge.cmd '"C:/Program Files/WinMerge/WinMergeU.exe" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE"'
git config --global difftool.prompt false
```

See [`examples/difftool.md`](../examples/difftool.md) for more examples. Paths are passed as separate `Command:arg` arguments, so spaces, Japanese characters, and parentheses do not depend on shell quoting.

## Notifications and troubleshooting

- Fewer or more than two tabs: enable `split-tabs.yazi` and show exactly two tabs.
- No target, multiple selection, or directory: select or place the cursor on exactly one regular file in each pane.
- `git` is missing or no difftool is configured: check `git --version` and `git difftool --tool-help`.
- Process launch failure: check the Diff tool executable's `PATH` and Git's difftool configuration.

The external process is started asynchronously and its exit state is monitored through Yazi's asynchronous API. Launch failures, wait failures, and non-zero exit statuses other than the expected `--no-index` difference result are reported as Yazi notifications. Waiting for the Diff tool does not block Yazi's main operation.

## Direct-launch extension

The initial implementation is fixed to Git Difftool. To launch WinMerge, VS Code, Beyond Compare, or another tool directly, replace only the command and arguments in `launch_diff`. Do not turn paths into a shell-built command string.

```lua
Command("code")
	:arg { "--diff", file1, file2 }
	:spawn()
```

## Known limitations and unsupported scope

- Three or more panes, three or more files, recursive directory comparison, and an in-Yazi Diff viewer are not supported.
- Operating on an inactive pane or comparing multiple selected files as a batch is not supported.
- The plugin reads the two tabs from Yazi's public `cx.tabs` API and does not modify `split-tabs.yazi` internals. A stable public mapping from `split-tabs.yazi` to physical screen-left/screen-right order is not available, so physical left/right ordering is not guaranteed.
- Yazi state alone cannot detect a file deleted immediately before comparison. In that case, the Git/Diff tool's exit status is reported as a Yazi notification.

The remaining unsupported capabilities and live acceptance work are tracked in [Issue #2](https://github.com/hironei/yazi_split_pane_diff/issues/2). Compatibility and live acceptance for the Yazi 26.8.15 selected-entry contract are tracked in [Issue #4](https://github.com/hironei/yazi_split_pane_diff/issues/4). The Lua mock tests do not cover the real Yazi screen, `split-tabs.yazi`, a configured external Diff GUI, Windows IME, or Windows focus behavior.

## Testing

Run the Lua mock tests with:

```bash
lua ./tests/test_main.lua
```

These tests do not replace live acceptance in Yazi, `split-tabs.yazi`, Git's external Difftool GUI, or Windows input and focus behavior.
